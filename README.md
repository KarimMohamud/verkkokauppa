# Verkkokauppa Store - School Project

This project is a mock online store for a fictional company. It was created during my first year of vocational school as a visual design exercise in 2020. The focus was purely on the frontend; there is no backend or functional features implemented.

## Features

The site consists of the following pages:

- Main Page: The homepage introducing the store.

- Tuotteet: A products page showcasing items available for purchase.

- Alennukset: A discounts page highlighting special offers.

- Tietoa Meistä: An "About Us" page providing company information.

- Yhteystiedot: A contact page for reaching out to the store.

- Kirjaudu Sisään: A login page (visual only).

- Rekisteröidy: A registration page (visual only).

## Limitations

- Frontend Only: The site is purely visual and lacks any backend functionality.

- No Interactivity: Buttons, forms, and links are static and do not perform actions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Purpose

The project was meant to practice basic web development as our first course in vocational school.
